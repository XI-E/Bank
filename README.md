# Berry Bank

_Simple bank program_
	
Reads account data from files, allows deposits, withdrawls and opening new accounts.

The data for the accounts is stored encrypted to ensure privacy of account holders using a simple custom encryption algorithm.
The accounts use a user generated 6 letter key for decrypting account data, which also serves as a password.
